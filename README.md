# Parmar_Meet_Crushing_Bugs
# HW #2 â€“ CRUSHING BUGS 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your desktop via terminal or access the live webpage via github-pages.
2. Once cloned/opened, navigate to the index.html file.
3. Have fun with the primitive version of the Drag and Drop puzzle.

## Usage

1. Open up the puzzle game and drag the pieces over to their appropriate drop zone.
2. To double check functionality, use the relevant console present in the browser. 
3. For maximum enjoyment, rewrite the order of functions written in the JS file to see the other ways one can arrive to similar conclusions/conditions/solution.

## History / Technologies Used

- [x] HTML
- [x] CSS
- [x] JavaScript (vanilla)

## TODO:
Fix the errors found in class using the build files provided (the Puzzle Drag and Drop). This is a research assignment; the difficulties listed in the brief must be resolved.

To enhance the user experience of the game, make new branches with appropriate names and update the functionality.

## Assignment Requirements:
Our puzzle game currently contains a few issues, at the very least. It shouldn't be possible to drag and drop more than one puzzle piece into a drop zone. Only one item should be present in each drop zone at a >me.


The second bug is the issue with puzzle parts showing up in the drop zones when a puzzle reset or new puzzle is selected. So that the player has a brand-new board to drop into, those should also be eliminated or returned to the drag zone.


Fix these two issues. To tackle the first issue, utilise the original drop function, and to address the second issue, use a different function. Try calling one function from another to see if you can get away without adding any event handling.

FIRST, put your plan in writing. If you don't know what to do, you can't solve a problem, whether it be one involving code or not. Think through the issue and use logic. Arranging the solution first will greatly aid in effectively completing the project.

## Additional Requirements
1. Include a written plan / path with your submission. Analyze the problem and provide the solu>on.
2. Create a Readme.md document for the repo with detailed informa>on about the project.
3. Create a branch for each bug and its solu>on. Provide the JS for each.
4. Merge everything to the master branch (keep all branches in your repo).
